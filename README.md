# Math For Machine Learning

These are the course files from the [Coursera Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).

I ran all of the Jupyter notebooks on Coursera's server and saved them statically in this repo. I saved the quizzes as PDFs. There were some formatting issues when downloading from Coursera, so apologies in advance.
